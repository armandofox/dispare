\section{Overview}
\label{overview}

This section contains an overview of how \dispare works.  The users
models his system as a {\em dependency graph} of smaller event nodes
connected by one way communication links.  The user sends information
between event nodes throught these links.  

The terminology used when discussing this dependecy graph is as follows.
Each node is called an {\em event}.  The
interconnections between the events are refered to as {\em Links} or {\em
archs in the dependency graph}.
Each Link is a unique unidirectional interconnection between two and only two
events.  With repect to eventA, any event that provides inputs to eventA
is called a parent of eventA.  Any event that receives an input from
eventA is called a child of eventA.

Associated with each event is an event chare and a state chare.  The
event chare is responsible for executing the C code the user has written
for the event.  The state chare is responsible for receiving the inputs
from other events, keeping track of the state of the event, and
initiating execution of the user's event code in the event chare.
